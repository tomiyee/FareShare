# RESTful Rust Backend

## Development

Using the library `cargo-watch`, it will watch for file changes and restart the entire server. (There is currently no support for hot reloading like you would have for frontend).

```sh
cargo watch -x run
```

You could also run the server manually if you are not interested in cargo-watch.

```sh
cargo run
```
